# MXNET-to-Keras-parser

See some awesome model in MXNET but you are working in Keras framework? Here comes a tool that converts an MXNET model definition to a Keras one.

This code currently parses both the weight and network definition from MXNET. However, the weight does not work well due to the different backend and numerical precision in two different framework. But this should serve as a good initialization though.

## Reuirement
* MXNET
* JSON
* Keras => 2

## How to use this?
Please refer to the demo.
